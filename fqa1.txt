# What is 9front?

Plan9front (or 9front) is a fork of the
[Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://9p.io/plan9/)
operating system.
The project was started to remedy a perceived lack of devoted
development resources inside Bell Labs, and has accumulated various
[fixes](http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/HEAD/info.html)
and
[improvements.](fqa1.html#1.3.1)

This FQA specifically covers only the most recent release of 9front.


## Cirno

At some point, [Cirno](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Cirno) became
associated with 9front. Details are sketchy, but this image has been in
the wiki since the Google Code days, so I'm leaving it in.

# Why might I want to use 9front?

It is very likely that you do not.

New users frequently want to know whether 9front is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating system. Consider: The question is largely
unanswerable. What are your criteria? Why are you even using computers
in the first place? Exploring these questions and the implications that
derive therefrom may help you sharpen your perceptions and eventually
come to some sort of conclusion about which operating system you prefer
to use for daily tasks.

Ultimately, whether or not 9front is for you is a question only you can
answer.

Note: The above text is lightly plagiarized from the
[OpenBSD FAQ.](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/)

## Why might I not want to use 9front?

Hold up. Before you get too excited, consider the following possibilities:
- You just realized you don't want to use Plan 9 at all.
- You don't like the people who use and/or work on 9front.
- You don't like 9front's propaganda.
- You prefer less functionality from your obscure OS, and/or you prefer
  to ignore 9front's public commit history and complain later because
  nobody informed you about bug fixes and new programs.
- You have technical objections to specific changes 9front made to the
  original Bell Labs code.
- You're not sure right now, but you'll know it when you see it.

Okay, carry on.

### Why did 9front stop making fun of Nazis?

}

Because you asked us to.
- People complained it was done in poor taste.
- People reliably interpret any depiction of a thing as an endorsement
  of same.
- We're tired of explaining this shit to people who just call us liars
  anyway. (To be fair, look at the world around us today. Why cloud the
  issue?)
  [*I'm through explainin the shit -- Ice T*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FWCSBpG5q8)
- Cognitive dissonance.
